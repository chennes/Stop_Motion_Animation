# Stop_Motion_Animation
A simple Processing-based stop-motion animation frame grabber

This small program uses the Processing (http://processing.org) programming environment to display a simple stop-motion animation
frame-grabbing utility. It is designed to have only the options absolutely required for simple stop-motion
animation, and is suitable for ages 10 and up. Frames are stored as TIFF files in the directory with the
program. You can use the frame-assembly program that comes with Processing if you want to create an
animation for viewing outside the program.

The program was written by Chris Hennes, Computer Training Center Assistant at Norman Public Library, a branch
of the Pioneer Library System in central Oklahoma, USA. It was designed for use in the library's stop-motion
programs.
