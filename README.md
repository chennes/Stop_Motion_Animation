# Stop_Motion_Animation
A C++ and Qt based stop-motion animation app.

This program provides a simplified stop-motion animation program suitable for ages 8 and up. It is designed specifically to minimize the number of options and reduce interface clutter so that kids can focus on creating their movie, and not on fighting with the user interface. It provides encoding via the FFmpeg program (included, or available at https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html). Background music and sound effects can be added directly from the interface, so for most classroom uses it functions as a stand-alone stop motion solution.

The program was written by Chris Hennes, Computer Training Center Assistant at Norman Central Public Library, a branch
of the Pioneer Library System in central Oklahoma, USA. It was designed for use in the library's stop-motion
programs.
