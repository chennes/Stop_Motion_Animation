# Stop_Motion_Animation
A simple Processing-based stop-motion animation frame grabber

This small program uses the Processing (http://processing.org) programming environment to display a simple stop-motion animation
frame-grabbing utility. It is designed to have only the options absolutely required for simple stop-motion
animation, and is suitable for ages 6 and up. Frames are stored as TIFF files in the directory with the
program. When you are done taking frames there is a simple encoding option that allows you to add a single audio 
file as background music and create a file suitable for sharing or uploading to social media.

The program was written by Chris Hennes, Computer Training Center Assistant at Norman Public Library, a branch
of the Pioneer Library System in central Oklahoma, USA. It was designed for use in the library's stop-motion
programs.
