	<h1>Help with Pioneer Library System's Stop Motion Animator</h1>
	<p>
	Welcome to Pioneer Library's System's Stop Motion Animation software. It's designed to be easy to use
	and hard to break.
	</p>
	<h2>Quick Start</h2>
	<p>
	Basically all you need to do is launch the software and start hitting the spacebar. All the images files
	are stored in a folder called "Image Files" within the same folder as the program, in sub-folders that are
	date- and time-stamped with the time the program launched. There is a play button to simply play back all 
	the frames you have taken at 15 frames per second.
	</p>
	<p>
	When you are completely done with your images, you can create an actual movie file for sharing (with an optional
	soundtrack that you will be prompted for) by clicking "Create Final Movie". The movie will be stored with the 
	images and called FinalMovie.mp4.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What do all the buttons do?</h2>
	This section provides a more detailed overview of exactly what each button does, including a little bit
	of technical detail.
	<h3>Start a New Movie</h3>
    Calculates a new date stamp (Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute-Second), resets your number of frames, and starts
	recording all new frames into a folder named with the new date stamp. It also re-initializes the camera, so
	if your camera wasn't ready when you first launched the program, clicking this will scan for cameras again.
	<h3>Add to Previous Movie</h3>
	Opens a window asking you to select a frame from a pre-existing movie. You can choose any frame you want, but
	the movie <em>must</em> be in the standard "Image Files/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS_Frame####.tif" format and
	location. If it is anywhere else you must use the "Import and Clean Frames" button instead. Adding to a previous 
	movie will reset your date stamp to that movie's original stamp, and update the number of frames to reflect the 
	frames you have already taken. New frames will simply be added to the end of that movie, just like you never
	closed it.
	<h3>Create final movie</h3>
	This assembles your frames into a single movie file (technically an MP4 file using H.264 encoding), along with
	an optional audio file as its soundtrack. When it is done encoding it will load up the movie in whatever your
	computer's default player is. This file can be used in Windows Live Movie Maker, Adobe Premiere, or basically any
	other video editing software to add credits, etc. or you can just share it on its own.
	<h3>Import</h3>
	The basic idea of this button is to let you choose any folder full of images anywhere on your computer and
	create a stop-motion animation from them. What is actually does is scan through the folder you select and
	locate all of the TIFF files (*.tif). It lists them alphabetically, then <em>moves</em> and <em>renames</em> them
	into a folder following the standard folder structure. This has a couple of uses: first, you can use it to
	move frames from somewhere else on your computer into the place where this program expects them to be. Second,
	you can use it to re-number frames of a movie where you have manually deleted (or added) frames from the
	middle. 
	<h3>Help</h3>
	Opens this help file in your default web browser.
	<h3>Take Photo</h3>
	Stores the currently-displayed webcam image into a TIFF-formatted image file in a folder named with the 
	date stamp displayed in the upper left corner of the window. We use TIFF so that playback is smooth, but keep
	in mind that these are pretty large files (around 1MB) so you need to make sure that the actual executable file
	for this program is located someplace with enough storage for all the movies.
	<h3>Delete Last Photo</h3>
	Deletes the most recently-taken photo. To delete photos from the middle of the movie you have to manually remove the 
	files and then import those frames using the "Import and Clean Frames" button.
	<h3>Play</h3>
	Loads up each frame and displays it for 1/15 of a second. Frames are loaded from their files on the disk, so we
	use the TIFF format so the load is fast. Playback is always 15 frames per second.
