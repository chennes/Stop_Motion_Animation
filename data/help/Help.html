        <h1>Help with PLS Stop Motion Creator</h1>
	<p>
        Welcome to Pioneer Library's System's Stop Motion Creator software. It's designed to let pretty
        much anyone at any age make their own movies, one image at a time.
	</p>
	<h2>Quick Start</h2>
	<p>
        Basically all you need to do is plug in a webcam, launch the software, and start hitting the spacebar. All the images files
	are stored in a folder called "Image Files" within the same folder as the program, in sub-folders that are
	date- and time-stamped with the time the program launched. There is a play button to simply play back all 
        the frames you have taken. The default playback rate is 15 frames per second, but this can be
        adjusted in the settings.
	</p>
        <p>
        If you want some help lining up your shots, holding down the <tt>x</tt> or <tt>z</tt> keys on
        your keyboard will switch to showing the previous shot. This won't affect the stored image,
        so it doesn't matter if you are still holding them down when you actually take the picture.
        </p>
	<p>
        When you are completely done with your images, you can create an actual movie file for sharing by clicking
        "Create Final Movie". The movie will be stored with the images and end with a ".mp4" extension.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What do all the buttons do?</h2>
	This section provides a more detailed overview of exactly what each button does, including a little bit
	of technical detail.
	<h3>Start a New Movie</h3>
    Calculates a new date stamp (Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute-Second), resets your number of frames, and starts
	recording all new frames into a folder named with the new date stamp. It also re-initializes the camera, so
	if your camera wasn't ready when you first launched the program, clicking this will scan for cameras again.
	<h3>Add to Previous Movie</h3>
        Opens a window asking you to select a pre-existing movie file (the filename will end in &quot;.json&quot;). It
        <em>must</em> be in the standard "Image Files/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.json" format and
	location. If it is anywhere else you must use the "Import and Clean Frames" button instead. Adding to a previous 
	movie will reset your date stamp to that movie's original stamp, and update the number of frames to reflect the 
	frames you have already taken. New frames will simply be added to the end of that movie, just like you never
	closed it.
	<h3>Create final movie</h3>
	This assembles your frames into a single movie file (technically an MP4 file using H.264 encoding), along with
	an optional audio file as its soundtrack. When it is done encoding it will load up the movie in whatever your
        computer's default player is.
	<h3>Import</h3>
	The basic idea of this button is to let you choose any folder full of images anywhere on your computer and
	create a stop-motion animation from them. What is actually does is scan through the folder you select and
        locate all of the JPEG files (*.jpg). It lists them alphabetically, then <em>copies</em> and <em>renames</em> them
	into a folder following the standard folder structure. This has a couple of uses: first, you can use it to
	move frames from somewhere else on your computer into the place where this program expects them to be. Second,
	you can use it to re-number frames of a movie where you have manually deleted (or added) frames from the
	middle. 
	<h3>Help</h3>
        Opens this help screen.
	<h3>Take Photo</h3>
        Stores the currently-displayed webcam image into a JPEG-formatted image file in a folder named with the
        date stamp displayed in the upper left corner of the window.
	<h3>Delete Last Photo</h3>
	Deletes the most recently-taken photo. To delete photos from the middle of the movie you have to manually remove the 
	files and then import those frames using the "Import and Clean Frames" button.
	<h3>Play</h3>
        Loads up each frame and displays it. The default playback rate is 15 frames per second, but this
        can be adjusted in the settings.

<h1>Credits</h1>
<p>This software was developed at the Norman, Oklahoma Central public library, a part of <a href="http://pioneerlibrarysystem.org">Pioneer Library
System</a>. The lead developer was Chris Hennes. Testing and debugging support was provided by Aaron Pence
and the many students who attended our stop motion animation programs.</p>

<p>The software relies upon the following open-source libraries:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a> - a graphical user interface library.</li>
<li><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> - various libraries for encoding video, as well as significant portions of example code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The icon for the program is based on two open-source icons from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a>:
